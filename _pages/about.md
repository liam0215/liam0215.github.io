I'm a PhD student at UCSD's Systems and Networking group, where I'm advised by [Amy Ousterhout](https://amyousterhout.com/) and [Alex Snoeren](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~snoeren/). My current research focuses on μs scale scheduling for hardware accelerators.

Before joining UCSD, I was a software engineer at Microsoft in the Core OS>Virtual Machines and Containers>Linux on Windows team, located in Seattle. Before that I was a research intern at the MPI-SWS [Operating Systems Group](https://os.mpi-sws.org/), where I was advised by [Antoine Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/index.html) and worked on investigating TCP stacks for virtualized environments and then for μs scale reconfigurable optical networks. I completed my Bachelor's degree at Cornell University where I conducted research (ongoing) under the supervision of [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/) investigating byzantine fault tolerant relational databases. 

I'm excited about computer systems, construed broadly, with an interest in tackling problems concerning the fault tolerance and performance of operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and computer architectures. Based on my past research experiences, I find two domains particularly fascinating: datacenter systems and networks, and byzantine fault tolerant systems.

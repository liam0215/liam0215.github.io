I am a research intern at the MPI-SWS [Operating Systems Group](https://os.mpi-sws.org/), where I am advised by [Antoine Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/index.html) and working on investigating TCP stacks for virtualized environments and more recently for Î¼s scale reconfigurable optical networks. Previously, I was a Bachelor's student at Cornell University where I conducted research (ongoing) under the supervision of [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/) investigating byzantine fault tolerant relational databases. 


<mark>I am currently applying to PhD programs!</mark> I'm excited about computer systems, construed broadly, with an interest in tackling problems concerning the fault tolerance and performance of operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and architecture. Based on my past research experiences, I find two domains particularly fascinating: datacenter systems and networks, and byzantine fault tolerant systems.

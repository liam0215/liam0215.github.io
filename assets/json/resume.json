Worked on extending TAS, an optimized userspace TCP stack, by adding optimizations for larger flows, including hardware offload and extended mbuf support (DPDK). I'm also working on Virtuoso, a host networking stack for virtualized environments. My primary contribution has been adding support for Docker containers and experiments. Virtuoso is currently under submission to NSDI'24 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14016).
